**Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) - Planning Stage Document**

**Project Name:** Backend for To-Do Application

---

### **1. Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to build a backend API for a simple To-Do application. The backend will handle all data processing and persistence while exposing RESTful endpoints for managing tasks. The application will be built using Spring Boot for the backend framework, MySQL as the relational database, and Docker for containerization. This project serves as an opportunity to learn and gain hands-on experience with these technologies while adhering to professional software engineering practices.

---

### **2. Project Goals**

- Develop a RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) tasks.
- Implement a robust and scalable backend using Spring Boot.
- Use MySQL for efficient and structured data storage.
- Ensure deployment readiness by containerizing the application with Docker.
- Deliver an MVP that can be expanded with additional features in the future.

---

### **3. Target Audience**

- **Primary Users**: Individuals looking for a simple, lightweight tool to organize daily tasks.
- **Purpose**: Provide a backend system that supports basic task management functionality, enabling users to interact with tasks programmatically via API endpoints.

---

### **4. Core Features**

#### **MVP Features:**

1. **Create a Task**:

   - Endpoint: `POST /tasks`
   - Functionality: Accepts task details such as title, description, and status, and stores them in the database.

2. **Retrieve Tasks**:

   - Endpoint: `GET /tasks`
   - Functionality: Fetches all tasks from the database and returns them to the user.

3. **Update a Task**:

   - Endpoint: `PUT /tasks/{id}`
   - Functionality: Updates the specified task with new details provided by the user.

4. **Delete a Task**:
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /tasks/{id}`
   - Functionality: Removes the specified task from the database.

#### **Future Enhancements:**

- Task categorization.
- Pagination for task retrieval.
- Due dates and reminder functionality.
- Authentication and Authorization using JWT.
- Task search and filtering options.

---

### **5. Technology Stack**

#### **Backend Framework:**

- Spring Boot (Java-based framework for building APIs).

#### **Database:**

- MySQL (Relational database for storing task data).

#### **Containerization:**

- Docker (For application containerization and deployment).

#### **Build Tool:**

- Maven or Gradle (Dependency and build management).

#### **Other Tools:**

- Postman (For API testing).
- Git/GitHub (For version control).
- Docker Compose (For managing multiple containers).

---

### **6. Risks and Mitigation**

#### **Technical Risks:**

- **Learning Curve**: Difficulty in mastering Spring Boot and Docker.

  - **Mitigation**: Follow official documentation and targeted tutorials for each tool.

- **Database Optimization**: Inefficient database queries.
  - **Mitigation**: Test queries thoroughly and use indexes for optimization.

#### **Project Risks:**

- **Scope Creep**: Adding too many features during development.
  - **Mitigation**: Stick to MVP features and document any additional feature requests for future iterations.

### **8. Outcome of the Planning Stage**

- Clear understanding of project goals and scope.
- Identification of core and future features.
- Defined technology stack to achieve the objectives.
- Detailed timeline to guide the development process.
